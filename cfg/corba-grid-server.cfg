# The content server defines the source of the content information. Usually the master 
# content source is the Redis database. However,it can be also a memory-based content
# server or a caching content server, which are accessed by HTTP or CORBA.

# The Redis database is not usually fast enough for our searching purposes. That's why 
# its information is usally cached locally into the memory. In this case the content 
# information can be sorted so that it can be fetched very fast. In spite of that we
# can sort the current content information in many ways, we should not sort it all
# possible ways because this increases the memory consumtion and it also makes content
# updates slower. In practice, we should select the main content identifiers and sort
# the content information according to them. All the other information should be mapped
# to those identifiers when querying content information.

# If the content source itself is a caching content server then there is usually no need to 
# locally cache the same information. Caching content information makes content searching very 
# fast but it might required a lot of memory. That's why it usually makes sense to use a remote 
# caching server if that is possible. On the other hand this means that the grid engine can start 
# much faster because it does not need to cache content information first.
